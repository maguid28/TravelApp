# Android Travel Application 

This application was built as part of my 3rd year project in Dublin City University.

The app serves the purpose of a travel companion and provides users with information about the country they are currently in. 
The app is designed with the physical safety of the user in mind and its main purpose is to provide users with updates on 
areas that might be considered unsafe as the user is travelling and also allows users to quickly contact the emergency 
services of the country they are currently in.

This app is designed for android mobile devices. It runs on Android 4.2+, and works in conjunction with the Google Maps API 
to provide users with an understanding of the area around them. This is done by allowing other users to report incidents 
and place warning markers on the map. The app will also warn users if the wander in to a dangerous area by sending them 
a notification if they get to near to a marker. The apps secondary features include a weather feature to show users todays 
current weather for their current location, an attractions feature to show users areas of interest in their current location, 
and a personal information feature for them to store personal information in the case of emergency.
